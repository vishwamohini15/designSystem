14:40:59.274 Retrieving git information
14:40:59.856 × Found only one commit
             This typically means you have ran into one of the following scenarios:
             - You've checked out a shallow copy of the Git repository, which some CI systems do by default.
               In order for Chromatic to correctly determine baseline commits, we need access to the full Git history graph.
               Refer to your CI provider's documentation for details.
             - You've only made a single commit so far.  
               Please make at least one additional commit in order for Chromatic to be able to detect what's changed.

14:41:09.867 i Skipping rebuild of an already fully passed/accepted build
             A build for the same commit as the last build on the branch is considered a rebuild.
             If the last build is passed or accepted, the rebuild is skipped because it shouldn't change anything.
             You can override this using the --force-rebuild flag.
